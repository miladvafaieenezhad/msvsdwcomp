# VSD Mixed-signal PD Research Program
<li> This is a 10-week program for taping out a chip using SKY130 technology.<br>
<li> In each week, participants need to do some tasks and meet requirements for being eligible to continue.<br>
<li> Some tasks could be covered in weeks.<br>
<li> For each week, a directory can be found containing all tasks and simulations I have done. <br>
  
 ## What I have done in each week is summarized below:<br>
  
### [week 0](https://github.com/miladvafaieenezhad/msvsdwcomp/tree/main/week%200) <br>

1.  Tools installed<br>
  
<li> Magic<br>   
<li> Xschem<br>
<li> Ngspice<br>
<li> Netgen <br>
<li> Align<br>
<br>
2. Pre-layout simulation<br>
  
<li> Inverter schematic in Xschem<br>
<li> Making symbol <br>
<li> Test and simulate the inverter<br>
<br>
3. Post-layout simulation<br>
  
<li> Layout implementation <br>
<li> Run LVS with using netgen<br>
<li> Post-layout simulation<br>
<li> Generating layout with using Align<br>
