# VSD Mixed-signal PD Research Program
<li> This repository is related to a 8-week program for taping out a chip using SKY130 technology.<br>
<li> In each week, participants need to do some tasks and meet requirements for being eligible to continue.<br>
<li> Some tasks could be covered in weeks.<br>
<li> For each week, a directory with all tasks and simulations I have done can be found. <br>
